Welcome to the 'mlbdfs' package! For the 2016 Major League Baseball season, I've decided to build an open source R package for managing daily fantasy sports (DFS) data. I'll be including:

-   Utilities for managing a database of MLB data, based on the [pitchRx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pitchRx/index.html) package. Note that for legal reasons I can *not* redistribute the actual data.
-   Utilities for managing a database of DFS contest results. Again, for various legal reasons I can only distribute the code and documentation, not data.
-   I *may* include projection and optimization tools later, but for the moment I'm more interested in having a solid infrastructure in place to help me manage my contest entries and analyze my results.

If you're interested in contributing, *please* read the [contributor code of conduct](https://github.com/znmeb/mlbdfs/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).
